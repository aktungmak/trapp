# trapp
a tree based application framework

This is a framework for building small utilities that require user quick and simple interaction. It is designed so that it is independent of the actual user interface used, a normal command line ui and a termbox based console ui are included.

The underlying concept is the representation of the application structure as a tree, where each node may have a function associated with it or a list of sub-options (or both).

The structure is therefore expressed declaritively, in code.

TODO add more details on usage and examples.
